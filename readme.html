<h1>Quake II VR v1.9.3 Pre-release</h1>

<p>This is a Quake II engine mod to add native support for Virtual Reality HMD's such as the Oculus Rift.</p>

<p>This mod is based on <a href="http://www.markshan.com/knightmare/">KMQuake II</a> and incorporates work from <a href="https://github.com/phoboslab/Quakespasm-Rift/">RiftQuake</a>.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Full version of <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/2320/">Quake II</a></li>
<li>Windows XP or higher</li>
<li>Oculus Rift or any SteamVR supported HMD</li>
<li>Pretty much any video card that supports DirectX 9 or higher</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<h4>Shareware Version</h4>

<ol>
<li>Download the shareware package and unzip it to your preferred directory.</li>
<li>Optionally download the high resolution texture package and unzip it to the same folder.</li>
<li>Run <code>quake2vr</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Full Version Instructions</h4>

<ol>
<li>Download binary or shareware package and unzip it to your preferred directory.</li>
<li>Optionally download the extra's package and unzip it to the same folder.</li>
<li>Copy the following files from your Quake II <code>baseq2</code> folder into the new <code>baseq2</code> folder:
<ul><li><code>pak0.pak</code> (overwrite it if you downloaded the shareware version)</li>
<li><code>players\</code> (optional - only if you want to play multiplayer. overwrite it if you downloaded the shareware version)</li>
<li><code>videos\</code> (optional - only if you want cinematics)</li></ul></li>
<li>If you have the CD audio soundtrack in .ogg format you can optionally place these files in <code>baseq2\music\</code>. Music files need to be named <code>track02.ogg</code> to <code>track11.ogg</code>.</li>
<li>Run <code>quake2vr</code> or choose one of the links provided in the extras pack. </li>
</ol>

<p>You can alternately just copy the contents of the extracted <code>Quake2VR</code> directory on top of an existing Quake II installation, however there is always the risk that this breaks the original installation.</p>

<p>If your Oculus Rift is connected and powered on it will enable support automatically at launch, but you can also enable Rift support by accessing the console using ~ and entering <code>vr_enable</code>. When it initializes it will attempt to locate the display that the Rift is configured as and use it, but if that fails it will default to the primary monitor.</p>

<h4>Aim mode warnings</h4>

<p>Aim modes that allow the mouse to adjust the view pitch are currently broken in multiplayer. These are denoted with an * in the VR settings menu, and are aim modes 2 and 4 if you set them through the cvar's.</p>

<h4>Modifications and Add-On's</h4>

<p>As this is based on KMQuake II, it supports any modification or add-on that is compatible with KMQuake II. The extra's package includes both high resolution model and world textures, and and I highly recommend turning on some of the advanced video options. That said, if you want a relatively pure experience the defaults settings will come pretty close to it.</p>
